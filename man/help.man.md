### ü§ñ Duegev Wiki Discord Bot

Duegev Wiki Discord Bot is a knowledge-base - a collection of articles and sources that can be extended and edited by players of the **Duegev** (formerly efe) rpg. For author/editor access you have to identify your Discord profile first by logging in. _Follow this help manual to get to know the details._

### üë§ Register your Discord User

You have to register your Discord user for creating / editing documents because we'll need your User ID to confirm your credentials when you perform a privileged action. 

1) First you have received a password from the database operator `Francis` - if not reach out.
2) Execute `?register <password>` in a private message with **DUEGEVBOT**
3) Your User ID will be associated with your actual identity.

**IMPORTANT** 

You only need to **register once** per Discord account. So once you registered, you'll only need to register once more if you create a new Discord account - because you abandoned the old one.
