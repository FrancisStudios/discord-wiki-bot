# 📖 DISCORD WIKI BOT

This is a **Wiki / Knowledge Base** bot 🤖 for _Discord_ imagined, designed and written by `Francis Studios` to fulfil a community need to have a single source of truth for our **RPG** which has grown too big over the years to store everything on paper. 

⭐ This Software was developed for `Dugev` (our game) firtly, but I open sourced this project so other people can deploy this product freely and have a similar (hopefully good) experience.

🟢 Version: `beta 0.0.4` - unstable


## ⌨️ Commands

This bot works by writing commands to it - which are similar to **unix** commands so command line / terminal users are in advantage here. 

You can dispatch commands in servers (where your bot has the right privileges) or in private by messaging the bot. 


Every command starts with a `?` to tell the bot that it has to interpret whatever comes after. 

You can start with a `?help` command to get some basic knowledge and a list of commands.

You can read manual pages for every command like `?help ls`

## 💽 Deployment

Our deployment is not public - due to privacy concerns but you can deploy this software on your server as well

**detailed deployment / hosting step-by-step tutorial will be here as soon as a stable version is released**
